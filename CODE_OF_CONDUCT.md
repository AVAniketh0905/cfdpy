# Code of Conduct

> TL;DR Be excellent to each other; we're a community after all. If you run into issues with others in our community, please conatct the Moderator.

## Purpose

The `fluidspy` Community includes members of varying skills, languages, personalities, cultural backgrounds, and experiences from around the globe. Through these differences, we continue to grow and collectively improve upon an open-source animation engine. When working in a community, it is important to remember that you are interacting with humans on the other end of your screen. This code of conduct will guide your interactions and keep it a positive environment for our developers, users, and fundamentally our growing community.

## Our Community

Members of the Community are respectful, open, and considerate. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to our positive environment, and include:

- **Being respectful.** Respectful of others, their positions, experiences, viewpoints, skills, commitments, time, and efforts.

- **Being open.** Open to collaboration, whether it's on problems, Pull Requests, issues, or otherwise.

- **Being considerate.** Considerate of their peers -- other fellow users and developers.

- **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.

- **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. `fluidspy` Community is dedicated to providing a positive environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, or socioeconomic status.
